**Spring 为什么需要 @Component，@Service, @Controller,@Repository 这些不同的注解,这样设计的好处?**

参考 Sprring 官方文档：- [CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.3.x/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations)

Spring provides further stereotype annotations: @Component, @Service, and @Controller. @Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component. @Repository, @Service, and @Controller are specializations of @Component for more specific use cases, for example, in the persistence, service, and presentation layers, respectively. Therefore, you can annotate your component classes with @Component, but by annotating them with @Repository, @Service, or @Controller instead, your classes are more properly suited for processing by tools or associating with aspects. For example, these stereotype annotations make ideal targets for pointcuts. It is also possible that @Repository, @Service, and @Controller may carry additional semantics in future releases of the Spring Framework. Thus, if you are choosing between using @Component or @Service for your service layer, @Service is clearly the better choice. Similarly, as stated above, @Repository is already supported as a marker for automatic exception translation in your persistence layer.
