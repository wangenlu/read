## Iterables and array-likes

There are two official terms that look similar, but are very different. Please make sure you understand them well to avoid the confusion.

- Iterables are objects that implement the Symbol.iterator method, as described above.
- Array-likes are objects that have indexes and length, so they look like arrays.
