## get start

There are problems with managing JavaScript projects this way:

- It is not immediately apparent that the script depends on an external library.
- If a dependency is missing, or included in the wrong order, the application will not function properly.
- If a dependency is included but not used, the browser will be forced to download unnecessary code.

Let's use webpack to manage these scripts instead.

## Asset Management

- Loading CSS
- Loading Images
- Loading Fonts
- Loading Data
- Global Assets

## Output Management

auto generate `index.html` with `bundle.js`

## Development

- Using source maps

```js
devtool: "inline-source-map";
```

- Choosing a Development Tool

There are a couple of different options available in webpack that help you automatically compile your code whenever it changes:

- webpack's Watch Mode
- webpack-dev-server
- webpack-dev-middleware

```js
    // webpack-dev-server
    devServer: {
        contentBase: './dist'
    },
```

In most cases, you probably would want to use `webpack-dev-server`, but let's explore all of the above options.

## code splitting

There are three general approaches to code splitting available:

- **Entry Points**: Manually split code using entry configuration.
- **Prevent Duplication**: Use the SplitChunks to dedupe and split chunks.
- **Dynamic Imports**: Split code via inline function calls within modules.
