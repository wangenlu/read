## New Further

> 对 `Further` 进行扩展

- Combining two asynchronous computations in one—both when they’re independent and when the second depends on the result of the first
- Waiting for the completion of all tasks performed by a set of Futures
- Waiting for the completion of only the quickest task in a set of Futures (possibly because they’re trying to calculate the same value in different ways) and retrieving its result
- Programmatically completing a Future (that is, by manually providing the result of the asynchronous operation)
- Reacting to a Future completion (that is, being notified when the completion happens and then having the ability to perform a further action using the result of the Future, instead of being blocked waiting for its result)

## Summary

1. 异步的执行任务，同时提供了同步(`non-async`)和异步(`async`)的方法
2. 默认使用的是 `ForkJoinPool`,可以指定自定义的 `Executor`(默认是一个任务一个线程)

## AsynchronousCompletionTask

> 所有的任务都会被 `AsynchronousCompletionTask` 包装，方便调试和追踪问题

## CompletableFuture Method

### CompletableFuture join

```java
public List<String> findPricesFuture(String product) {
    List<CompletableFuture<String>> priceFutures =
            shops.stream()
            .map(shop -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> shop.getName() + " price is "
                    + shop.getPrice(product), executor))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    // List ComplateableFuature -> List
    List<String> prices = priceFutures.stream()
            .map(CompletableFuture::join)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    return prices;
}
```

## Customer Thread Pool Size

```java
Nthreads = NCPU * UCPU * (1 + W/C)
```

- NCPU is the number of cores, available through Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()
- UCPU is the target CPU utilization (between 0 and 1), and
- W/C is the ratio of wait time to compute time
